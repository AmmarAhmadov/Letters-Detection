# Letters-Detection
Detect English letters in an image using image processing and machine learning.
To run the project run the main file.
you can test the algorithms for the images in the folder "Examples".
"TemplateCreation.m" file is to to create the test set.
"Train.m" to train the network.
you don't need to train the network. it is already trained. you have to load the "net.mat" only.
again: just run the Main file and before that change the path of matlab to the path of the project.
